<h1 style="font-size: 36px;">Credit Card Fraud Detection</h1>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict fraudulent credit card transactions. The dataset used in this project is publicly available and contains anonymized credit card transactions made by European cardholders over a two-day period in September 2013. The dataset is highly unbalanced, with only 0.17% of the transactions labeled as fraudulent. </p>
<h1 style="font-size: 36px;">Project Overview</h1>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">The project is divided into the following steps </p>
1-Data Preparation and Exploration: 
In this step, we perform univariate and bivariate analysis to understand the distribution of each feature and their relationship with the target variable.


2-Data Preprocessing: Since the dataset is highly unbalanced, we use oversampling techniques such as SMOTE to balance the classes. 


3-Model Selection and Training: We use various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, SVM, and neural networks to train the data. We compare the performance of each model using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
<h1 style="font-size: 36px;">Conclusion</h1>
<p style="font-size: 20px;"> This project demonstrates the use of machine learning algorithms to detect credit card fraud. By performing univariate and bivariate analysis, handling an imbalanced class problem using oversampling techniques, and comparing the performance of various machine learning models, we can develop a model that can accurately predict fraudulent transactions. With the deployment of the model in a production environment, we can ensure that credit card fraud is detected in real-time and appropriate actions are taken to prevent financial loss.</p>
