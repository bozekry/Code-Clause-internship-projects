# Code-Clause-internship-projects
### This project mainly focuses on handling imbalanced datasets and detecting credit-card frauds using Machine Learning Algorithms:
#### a)Linear models like (Logistic Regression,Logistic Regression CV,Passive Aggressive Classifier,Perceptron,RidgeClassifier,SGDClassifier)
#### b)Ensemble Methods like ("Boosting":["AdaBoostClassifier","GradientBoostingClassifier","XGboost"],"Bagging":["Randomforest"])
#### c)Naive Bayes
### Model building with balancing Classes Perform class balancing with :  Oversampling SMOTE
